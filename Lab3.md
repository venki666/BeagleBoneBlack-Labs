# Programming using Scripting Languages - Lab 3
## Connecting you BBB to the Router and running Cloud9-IDE:
Connect the BBB to you router (wired connection for now). Note the ip address of the BBB from your router configuration page. For example 192.168.0.22 (find your respective ip). Now type http://beaglebone.local or http://beaglebone.local:3000 or http://192.168.0.22:3000/ to open the Cloud9-IDE.

There are some neat node.js buttons on http://beaglebone.local/bonescript.html

## BoneScript
Bonescript is a Node.js library specifically optimized for the Beagle family, featuring familiar Arduino function calls, exported to the browser. The BoneScript library provides several functions useful for interacting with your hardware. The following [link][1] provides a dozen of hardware demos that interact with the BeagleBone Black.
